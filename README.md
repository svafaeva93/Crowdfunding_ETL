# Crowdfunding_ETL Mini Project 

For this ETL mini project, worked with Taruna Bansala to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After the data was transformed, four CSV files were created and used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database.

The tasks for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

- Create the Category DataFrame and the Subcategory DataFrame
- Create the Campaign DataFrame 
- Create the Contacts DataFrame 
- Create the Crowdfunding Database
