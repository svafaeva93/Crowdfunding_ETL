# Crowdfunding_ETL Mini Project 

For this ETL mini project, worked with Taruna Bansala to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After the data was transformed, four CSV files were created and used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database.

The tasks for this mini project were divided into the following subsections:

- Category DataFrame and the Subcategory DataFrame
- Campaign DataFrame 
- Contacts DataFrame
- Crowdfunding Database
